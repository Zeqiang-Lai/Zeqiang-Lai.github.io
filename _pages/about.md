I am currently a graduate student of Computer Science at the Beijing Institute of Technology. My primary work focus on the research of computer vision, especially the applications of deep learning on image processing, optimization, generated modeling. I am also interested in the development of useful and fun tools, you can find the source code of these projects on my Github.
