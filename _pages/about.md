I am a third year graduate student at Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Ying Fu](https://ying-fu.github.io/publication.html).

My research interest lies in the optimization and computer vision. Previously, I primarily worked on diffusion models, proximal algorithm modeling, and image restoration. I also gained experience in some high-level vision tasks during the internship at [OpenGVLab](https://github.com/OpenGVLab).

<!-- I will be graduated at July 2023 and open for job opportunity. -->
